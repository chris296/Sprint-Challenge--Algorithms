#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n)
Every time you add 1 to n it takes exactly one more step to complete the process



b) Logarithmic O(n log n)
j is doubled with each step in the process so the greater the input, the greater the rate at which j increases.


c) Linear O(n)
The function is simply returning a 2 for each bunny so as the amount of bunnies increases, the amount of steps increase at the same rate.

## Exercise II
You could use a binary search tree by dropping an egg of the middle floor and seeing if it breaks. If the egg does break then you check the floor that is inbetween the middle and first floor(1/4) and if the egg still breaks then you check half way below that floor(1/8) or if it doesn't break you would check halfway above that(3/8) and continue this process until you find it.

The runtime complexity of this would be Logarithmic O(log n)
